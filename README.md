# FortuneCookie

## Overview
This project is a simple Java program that generates a random fortune each time it runs. Originally created for my Java 1 course, this was one of the first programs where I got to see my code produce something fun and interactive. While the logic behind it is straightforward, I really enjoyed the quirky and entertaining nature of the project. It was a great introduction to working with arrays, randomization, and console output.

## C.C.A.R.R.

**Challenge/Context:**  
At the time I wrote this program, I was just getting started with Java and programming in general. This project was an opportunity to apply basic concepts like storing data in an array and selecting a random value. I wanted to create something that felt less like an assignment and more like a fun, small program that could bring a little joy to whoever ran it.

**Action:**  
I built a simple Java program that stores a list of fortunes in an array. When executed, it randomly selects one fortune and displays it on the console. This required me to use the Random class to generate a random index, access the corresponding fortune, and print it to the screen. At the time, this was one of the first moments where I saw how code could create unpredictable, engaging results, and I found that exciting.

**Result:**  
Each time the program runs, the user gets a different fortune. While the logic behind it is simple, the randomness made it feel dynamic and fresh. I shared it with some classmates, and we had fun testing out what fortunes we’d get. It was a small project, but it was the first time I created something that felt more like an experience than just an output of code.

**Reflection:**  
Looking back, this project reminds me of how far I’ve come since learning the basics. At the time, getting a program to display different results dynamically felt like a big deal. Now, I’ve worked on far more complex projects, but I still appreciate how this one made me realize that programming can be creative and fun. If I were to revisit it, I’d consider expanding it—maybe adding a GUI, themed fortune categories, or even a web-based version. It’s always cool to see how much we grow when we look back at our early work!
