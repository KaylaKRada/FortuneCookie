# 🥠 FortuneCookie – Java Random Fortune Generator  
**Course:** Java I  
**Created by:** Kayla Rada  

---

## ✨ Overview
This was one of my very first Java programs, created during Programming With Java 1. It’s a simple, console-based app that gives you a random fortune each time it runs. Nothing fancy; just something lighthearted and fun that made learning arrays, random numbers, and output feel way more interesting than your average assignment.

Even though the code is basic, this project made a huge impact on me. It was the first time I realized how programming could be creative, unpredictable, and even a little silly. It felt like a program someone would actually enjoy running!

## 🚗 CCARR Breakdown (Challenge, Context, Action, Result, Reflection)

### 🔹 **Challenge / Context**
At the time, I was just getting started with Java and with programming in general. I wanted to practice storing and accessing data, using arrays, and working with randomness. But I also wanted to make something that felt less like a “homework problem” and more like a fun little surprise generator.

### 🔧 **Action**
I wrote a Java program that stores a list of quirky fortunes in an array. When it runs, it uses the `Random` class to pick one at random and display it to the user in the console. I learned how to work with indexed data, how to import and use libraries, and how to create basic logic that made the output feel fresh every time.

### ✅ **Result**
The result is a fun and simple fortune generator. Every time you run it, you get a new random message—sometimes funny, sometimes odd, always unpredictable. I shared it with some classmates, and we all got a kick out of seeing what the “fortune cookie” would say next.

### 💭 **Reflection**
This project brings back some really good memories. It may have been small, but it was a turning point, it made programming feel alive. Since then, I’ve built more complex systems and explored different languages, but this project is a great reminder of how far I’ve come. I actually revisited it later and re-created it in JavaScript so I could feature it on my portfolio site. Now, visitors can click a button and get a fortune instantly. It’s a small thing, but it shows how far I’ve come... from learning Java basics to building real, interactive web elements that bring a bit of joy to the user.
