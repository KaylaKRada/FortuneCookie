## ✨ Overview
This was one of my very first Java programs, created during my intro to Java course. It’s a simple, console-based app that gives you a random fortune each time it runs. Nothing fancy—just something lighthearted and fun that made learning arrays, random numbers, and output feel way more interesting than your average assignment.

Even though the code is basic, this project made a huge impact on me. It was the first time I realized how programming could be creative, unpredictable, and even a little silly. It felt like a program someone would actually enjoy running—just for fun.

## 🚗 CCARR Breakdown (Challenge, Context, Action, Result, Reflection)

### 🔹 **Challenge / Context**
At the time, I was just getting started with Java—and with programming in general. I wanted to practice storing and accessing data, using arrays, and working with randomness. But I also wanted to make something that felt less like a “homework problem” and more like a fun little surprise generator.

### 🔧 **Action**
I wrote a Java program that stores a list of quirky fortunes in an array. When it runs, it uses the `Random` class to pick one at random and display it to the user in the console. I learned how to work with indexed data, how to import and use libraries, and how to create basic logic that made the output feel fresh every time.

### ✅ **Result**
The result is a fun and simple fortune generator. Every time you run it, you get a new random message—sometimes funny, sometimes odd, always unpredictable. I shared it with some classmates, and we all got a kick out of seeing what the “fortune cookie” would say next.

### 💭 **Reflection**
This project brings back some really good memories. It may have been small, but it was a turning point—it made programming feel alive. Since then, I’ve built more complex systems and explored different languages, but this project is a great reminder of how far I’ve come. If I revisited it, I’d love to turn it into a small GUI app, or even make it into a web-based fortune generator just for fun.
